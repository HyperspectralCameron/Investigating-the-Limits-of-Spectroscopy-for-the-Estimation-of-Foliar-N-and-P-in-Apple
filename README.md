Predicting-Leaf-Nitrogen-and-Phosphorus-Concentrations-in-Apple-using-UV-VIS-NIR-spectroscopy

Herein lies the raw data and code to reproduce the results presented in C.Cullinan and A.Scomparin et al., 2024, 
Predicting Leaf Nitrogen and Phosphorus Concentrations in Apple using UV-VIS-NIR spectroscopy - beyond the proof of concept

All file paths are in the script are relative to the location of the script, therefore the file structure should be preserved.

Extract the raw data files into the main folder (not into its own folder). In the main folder there should be a folder for
each of the SED files, Excel trees and Analysis Results. The script should then access these directories without any need to
respecify file locations.
